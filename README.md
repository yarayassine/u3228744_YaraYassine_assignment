Reflection. 

This unit was very much not what I was expecting, can’t decide if it is in a bad way or not. Beginning the process of this assignment I was extremely lost and personally I ended it also extremely lost. My biggest issue was trying to implement my creativity that I would be able to do in a different program such was wix or square-space. Being creative in brackets was a lot harder than I had thought it would be, I wasn’t able to find the specific tables I wanted or the colours I was wanting to use. The most simple things such as spacing, images and type sizes became quite a large challenge. I spent a lot of time researching and using different websites to help me figure out where I went wrong in my codes. By the end I wasn’t exactly impressed with my website, it looks sloppy, unfinished and boring, which is something that I hated and tried quite hard to fix but unfortunately I think html and css is just not for me and I now appreciate each website I click on much more frequently than before. My time management was horrible and I extremely underestimated how long and how much effort this website would be to create. Overall I learnt new things that I never thought I would and accomplished more than I expected. Next time I would like to use more colours and a larger variety of fonts to make my website look a little less boring.
